        Youngsters today often struggle to identify rotten fruits, leading to poor purchasing decisions, food wastage, and health issues.<br>
        <br>
        FruitIQ (Fruit Inspection & Quality) aims to solve this by using machine learning to detect fruit quality.
        By uploading a photo of a fruit before buying it, users receive instant feedback on its condition.
        This tool helps youngsters avoid rotten fruits, ensuring they buy only the freshest produce, thereby promoting better health and reducing food waste.<br>
      <br>
        FruitIQ offers a user-friendly interface where individuals can upload images of fruits for instant analysis and evaluation of their quality.
        Leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms, Frui provides accurate assessments regarding the freshness, ripeness, and overall condition of fruits,
        helping users identify and avoid purchasing spoiled or low-quality produce.
